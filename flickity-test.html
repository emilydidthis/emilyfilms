                <h2 id="gogo">GoGo</h2>
                <p>GoGo is a fictional tech company, and its flagship product is a handheld teleportation device. (Crazy, I know.) Their mission is to deliver the future and get you to where you want to be. With my branding, I wanted to boast a product thatâ€™s high-tech but sleek, powerful but simple. </p>

                <p><a href="http://www.deepseastudios.lv">Deep Sea Studios</a> is an arts collective and film production company based in Riga, Latvia. I designed and coded their website, keeping in mind to let their beautiful imagery take focus. The site is responsive for all device widths and integrates with external libraries for attributes like the grid and image carousels. </p>

                <p>I designed and animated the title sequence for the comedy web series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ognBT8LIk">What If I...</a> In the show, neurotic New Yorker Jamie imagines how her smallest decisions could have catastrophic results. I wanted the imagery in the title sequence to reflect the odd and unique situations Jamie creates in her head.</p>

                <h2 id="fuck">Motherfu*ker!</h2>

                <p>Tarantino films are relentless in their use of profanity. I thought it would be fun  to design bold infographics to show just how vulgar the language is. With data collected by <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/tarantino/tarantino.csv">FiveThirtyEight</a>, I was able to communicate swear words by their frequency and highlight the film that swore the most.</p>

                <p>I animated a landing page for MMM HMM's floral edition of their online food magazine. I wanted it to be energetic and spunky to reflect their fun content. </p>

                <p>This was a little short that I made to highlight NYU-TV's Women's Herstory Month programming. And what better way to celebrate women than to hear from some of the greatest women themselves. The women featured in this short animation are so iconic that even in the simple way I illustrated them, you can clearly distinguish who they are. </p>

                <p>Textpectations is about a girl who waits anxiously for a text back from her crush. She's bombarded with messages from everyone but him, and the sensory overload from her phone becomes overwhelming.</p>
