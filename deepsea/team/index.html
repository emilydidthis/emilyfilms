                        <p class="info"> When he's not behind the camera, Deep Sea Studios founder Rudolfs is probably out working on his family's many acres of forest land. A real nature soul, he is one of the most promising upcoming directors in Latvia. Rudolfs's first short Flames on the Soil (2016) was nominated for the Latvian National Film Award for Best Debut. He currently studies Filmmaking at the Baltic Film & Media School. </p>

                        <p class="info"> Zane has perhaps the most important quality a producer may wish for: she's able to talk nearly anyone into helping the production reach its goal. From the far borderlands of Latvia comes one of the most talanted young producers in the country, who has worked on award-winning and large-scale fictiona and documentary films such as The Converts (2016) and Baltic Tribes (2018). Zane is currently an MFA Producing fellow at AFI Conservatory in Los Angeles. </p>

He has experience as DP on award-winning documentaries and features, including One Ticket Please (2017), The Lesson (2014) and Family Instinct (2012).
